# Database Design & Schema Management

## When to Use

- Designing a new database schema or adding tables
- Reviewing an existing schema for correctness, performance, or security
- Planning migrations (especially for production data)
- Designing indexes for query patterns
- Defining retention/deletion policies for sensitive data
- Evaluating SQLite vs PostgreSQL for a given use case

## SQLite vs PostgreSQL Decision

| Factor | SQLite | PostgreSQL |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Single-user/process | Yes | Overkill |
| Multi-tenant | No | Yes |
| Multi-process writes | No (WAL helps reads) | Yes |
| Sensitive data needing RBAC | No | Yes (row-level security) |
| Schema migrations needed | Manual/limited | Alembic, full ALTER support |
| Production deployment | Embedded only | Always appropriate |
| Full-text search | FTS5 (basic) | tsvector/tsquery (rich) |
| JSON queries | json_extract (basic) | jsonb (rich, indexed) |

**Rule:** If multi-tenant or handling financial/PII data → PostgreSQL. No exceptions.

## Schema Design Checklist

### 1. Table Design
```
□ Every table has a clear, singular purpose
□ Primary key defined (prefer INTEGER AUTOINCREMENT or UUID, not natural keys)
□ Foreign keys declared with ON DELETE behavior (CASCADE, SET NULL, RESTRICT)
□ NOT NULL on every column that should never be empty
□ DEFAULT values for columns with sensible defaults
□ No VARCHAR without length limit on user-facing input
□ Created_at and updated_at timestamps on every mutable table
□ No redundant data that can be derived from joins
```

### 2. Naming Conventions
```
□ Tables: plural snake_case (users, audit_events, context_chunks)
□ Columns: singular snake_case (user_id, created_at, token_count)
□ Foreign keys: {referenced_table_singular}_id (user_id, blob_hash)
□ Indexes: idx_{table}_{columns} (idx_users_email, idx_chunks_hash_index)
□ Constraints: {type}_{table}_{columns} (uq_aliases_alias_namespace, fk_chunks_hash)
```

### 3. Normalization
- **1NF:** No repeating groups, no arrays in columns (use junction tables)
- **2NF:** Every non-key column depends on the full primary key
- **3NF:** No transitive dependencies (column A → column B → column C)
- **Denormalize intentionally** only for proven performance needs, document why

### 4. Index Strategy
```
□ Primary keys are automatically indexed
□ Foreign keys need explicit indexes (PostgreSQL does NOT auto-index FK columns)
□ Add indexes for WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY columns in hot queries
□ Composite indexes: leftmost column must be the most selective
□ Covering indexes for read-heavy queries (include all SELECT columns)
□ Partial indexes for queries that filter on a constant (WHERE status = 'active')
□ Do NOT index columns with low cardinality (boolean, enum with 3 values)
□ Do NOT index columns that are rarely queried
```

### 5. Multi-Tenant Isolation
```
□ Tenant ID column on every tenant-scoped table
□ Every query includes WHERE tenant_id = ? (no exceptions)
□ Composite unique constraints include tenant_id: UNIQUE(alias, tenant_id)
□ Row-level security (PostgreSQL) or application-level enforcement
□ Test: Tenant A cannot read Tenant B's data (explicit cross-tenant test)
□ Indexes include tenant_id as prefix for tenant-scoped queries
```

### 6. Sensitive Data
```
□ PII columns identified and documented
□ Encryption-at-rest for SSN, EIN, account numbers (application-level Fernet or PG pgcrypto)
□ No PII in indexes (encrypted columns cannot be indexed — use blind index pattern)
□ Retention policy defined: how long, auto-delete mechanism, audit trail for deletions
□ Audit log table: who accessed what, when, from where (append-only, no DELETE permission)
□ Backup encryption for database dumps containing PII
```

## Migration Strategy

### Alembic (Python/SQLAlchemy)
```bash
# Initialize
alembic init alembic

# Create migration from model changes
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "add user_roles table"

# Apply
alembic upgrade head

# Rollback
alembic downgrade -1
```

### Migration Safety Rules
```
□ Never DROP COLUMN in production without a deprecation period
□ Add columns as NULLABLE first, backfill, then add NOT NULL constraint
□ Rename via: add new column → copy data → drop old column (not ALTER RENAME)
□ Large data migrations: batch in chunks (1000-10000 rows) to avoid lock contention
□ Always test migration AND rollback on a copy of production data
□ Migrations must be idempotent (safe to run twice)
□ No data-dependent migrations in the same transaction as schema changes
```

### SQLite Migrations (No Alembic)
SQLite has limited ALTER TABLE support. For schema changes:
1. Create new table with desired schema
2. Copy data from old table
3. Drop old table
4. Rename new table to old name
5. Recreate indexes and triggers

Wrap in a transaction. Test on a copy first.

## Schema Review Protocol

When reviewing an existing schema:

1. **Read the migration files or CREATE TABLE statements**
2. **Map entity relationships** — draw the FK graph mentally
3. **Check for missing indexes** on FK columns and WHERE clause columns
4. **Check for missing constraints** — can invalid data be inserted?
5. **Check tenant isolation** — is tenant_id on every tenant-scoped table? In every query?
6. **Check for PII** — is sensitive data identified and protected?
7. **Check for orphans** — can rows exist without their parent? (missing ON DELETE CASCADE)
8. **Check for N+1 patterns** — are related entities fetched in loops instead of JOINs?
9. **Output:** findings table with severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low) and recommended fix

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Bad | Fix |
|-------------|-------------|-----|
| EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) | Unqueryable, no type safety | Proper columns or JSONB |
| Soft deletes everywhere | Accumulates garbage, complicates queries | Hard delete + audit log |
| UUID primary keys on large tables | 4x storage, worse cache locality | BIGINT + UUID as alternate key |
| Storing JSON blobs for structured data | No referential integrity | Normalize into tables |
| Missing ON DELETE behavior | Orphaned rows | Explicit CASCADE/RESTRICT |
| Composite primary keys on 3+ columns | Awkward FK references, join complexity | Surrogate key + unique constraint |

## Integration

- **tdd:** Write schema tests first (can I insert valid data? rejected invalid data?)
- **repo-hardening-workflow:** Schema review is part of the data governance phase
- **code-quality:** N+1 queries and missing indexes are performance findings
